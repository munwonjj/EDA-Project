# MTA Traffic Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis Project with visualization using New York MTA dataset

## Goal 

The goal of this project is to utilize MTA turnstile data to investigate the change in ridership throughout different commuting times during/pre covid period.
January to April dataset from both 2018 and 2021 was respectively used to compare the ridership change pre covid and during covid. These dataset was used to identify popular stations throughout different time of the day. SQL was used to generate a database and Python was mainly used for data manipulation and visualziation.

## Data

This project uses the Turnstile Data provided by Metropolitan Transportation Authority(MTA). January to April dataset from both 2018 and 2021 was selected so ridership could be compared with pre and during covid period. The dataset consists of more than 5,000,000+ observations.
